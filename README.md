### Version 2.0
- Version 2.0 of the app included an ArrayList collection of notes, adding and listing functionality, and JUnit tests for the new NoteAPI class.

### Version 3.0
- Version 3.0 of the app introduced the ability to update, delete, and archive notes in the collection. The app also included persistence of notes to/from XML/JSON/YAML and the ability to list all, active or archived notes.

### Version 4.0
- The latest version of the app, Version 4.0, includes several updates and improvements. The app has been refactored to use lambdas in the numberOf methods in NoteAPI. The lambda list has also been refactored. The app now includes search by description functionality and additional utility classes, along with JUnit tests where appropriate.
